Perfect 👌 thanks for sharing your current directory. I see your C:\Users\df\Desktop\kingdom-ark-site already has the foundation plus some completed files. Right now, the topics folder only has part-1.html. To keep momentum and stay consistent with our plan, let’s extend the topics folder so it’s ready for all the parts (we’ll gradually fill the content).

Here’s the enhanced full structure with what you have + the missing pieces (I’ll mark ✅ = already filled with content, 📄 = file created but empty/placeholder, 🕊️ = next to be filled with studies):

📂 kingdom-ark-site (root)

📄 index.html ✅

📄 about.html ✅

📄 contact.html ✅

📄 newsletter.html ✅

📄 privacy.html ✅

📄 terms.html ✅

📄 sitemap.xml ✅

📄 robots.txt 📄

📄 manifest.webmanifest 📄

📄 sw.js 📄

📄 feed.xml 📄

📄 LICENSE 📄

📄 README.md 📄

📄 structure ✅

📂 assets

(css, js, images — already being filled as we go ✅)

📂 blog

📄 index.html ✅

📄 post-template.html ✅

📂 store

📄 index.html ✅

📂 printables

(empty for now — will hold study packs / downloads 📄)

📂 topics

📄 part-1.html 🕊️ (Jewish Roots Before Jesus – DONE)

📄 part-2.html 🕊️ (Second Temple Judaism & Messianic Expectation – IN PROGRESS)

📄 part-3.html 📄 (Jesus’ Teachings & Radical Reinterpretations)

📄 part-4.html 📄 (The Apostolic Age & Early Church)

📄 part-5.html 📄 (Persecutions, Councils & Doctrinal Battles)

📄 part-6.html 📄 (Books Removed, Hidden, & Contested Scriptures)

📄 part-7.html 📄 (Rise of Roman Christianity & Shaping Orthodoxy)

📄 part-8.html 📄 (Medieval Faith, Mystics, & Jewish-Christian Encounters)

📄 part-9.html 📄 (Reformations, Counter-Reformations, and Beyond)

📄 part-10.html 📄 (Modern Faith, Ancient Roots – Continuity & Challenges)

✅ That way:

The site skeleton is now complete.

We can fill topics/part-2.html fully (our current task).

After each part, you’ll also have a printable PDF study pack in /printables as a bonus lead magnet.
