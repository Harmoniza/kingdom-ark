    <h2>1.1 – The Ark of the Covenant: A Mystery Waiting</h2>
    <p>
      The Ark of the Covenant has always been wrapped in mystery. It was said to
      contain the <span title="Exodus 25:10–22">Ten Commandments</span>, the
      <span title="Numbers 17">Rod of Aaron</span>, and a jar of manna—physical
      signs of God’s presence among His people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, after the destruction of the Temple (586 BCE), it vanished. Some
      traditions say it was hidden by Jeremiah, others say it was taken by the
      Babylonians, Ethiopians, or even carried away by angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prophecy suggests the Ark will not remain hidden forever. Certain
      scriptures and oral traditions tie its rediscovery to the
      <em>end of days</em>—a time when God’s Kingdom would be revealed in full.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must Israel be restored first?</li>
      <li>Must the true Kingdom of God be understood before it appears?</li>
      <li>Or is the Ark’s discovery tied to something <em>within</em>, not just without?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.2 -->
  <section id="ark-prophecies" class="content">
    <h2>1.2 – Prophecies of the Ark’s Return</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible never directly says when the Ark will reappear—but Jewish,
      Christian, and Islamic traditions tie it to final restoration.
    </p>
    <h3>A. Jeremiah 3:16–17</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “They will no longer say, ‘The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.’ It will
      never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will
      another one be made. At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of
      the Lord.”
    </blockquote>
    <h3>B. 2 Maccabees 2:4–8</h3>
    <p>
      The prophet Jeremiah hid the Ark in a cave on Mount Nebo, saying it would
      remain hidden until “God gathers His people again and shows His mercy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>Syriac and Ethiopic traditions</strong>, the Ark is guarded by
      angels until it accompanies the Messiah in glory. Its return is linked to
      <strong>repentance, restoration, and revelation</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.3 -->
  <section id="jesus-kingdom" class="content">
    <h2>1.3 – Jesus and the Hidden Kingdom</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “The Kingdom of God is within you.” – <span title="Luke 17:21">Luke 17:21</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” – <span title="John 2:19">John 2:19</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If the Ark was the container of God’s presence, Jesus was claiming to be
      the living Ark. His followers—those filled with the Spirit—become temples
      themselves. The prophecy turns inward: the Ark will be found when the
      Kingdom within is rediscovered.
    </p>

  <!-- 1.4 -->
  <section id="zion-ark" class="content">
    <h2>1.4 – Zion, the Ark, and the True People</h2>
    <p>
      Zionist thought often ties God’s promises only to the physical land of
      Israel. Yet, even ancient Jewish mystics and prophets questioned whether
      the true Zion was more than geography.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span title="Isaiah 60:14">Isaiah 60:14</span> – Zion as a place where God’s glory dwells</li>
      <li><span title="Revelation 21">Revelation 21</span> – New Jerusalem descending from heaven</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Could the Ark’s true fulfillment be in the <em>New Zion</em> rather than
      old Jerusalem? Could Zion be the collective of those who awaken to the
      Kingdom within?
    </p>

  <!-- 1.5 -->
  <section id="lost-books" class="content">
    <h2>1.5 – Lost Books and Why They Matter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>God’s presence within rather than only in rituals.</li>
      <li>Prophecies of restoration beyond political Israel.</li>
      <li>Mystical, symbolic truths threatening rigid control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Thomas:</strong> “The Kingdom of God is inside you, and it is outside you…”</li>
      <li><strong>Book of Enoch:</strong> Heavenly tablets, hidden mysteries, future revelations.</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Philip:</strong> True Temple is union of divine truth with human soul.</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Mary Magdalene:</strong> Hidden teachings on soul’s ascent and liberation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.6 -->
  <section id="pre-israel-origins" class="content">
    <h2>1.6 – The Origin Before Israel</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sumerian & Egyptian temples with “god-boxes”</li>
      <li>Ethiopian traditions of a sacred vessel brought by Menelik</li>
      <li>Mesopotamian tablets of destiny</li>
      <li>Vedic traditions referencing divine chests storing heavenly words</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Ark is part of a universal human archetype: the desire to hold, guard,
      and carry God’s presence. Prophecy redirects this search inward.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.7 -->
  <section id="ongoing-mystery" class="content">
    <h2>1.7 – The Ongoing Mystery</h2>
    <p>
      The Ark may yet be found physically—perhaps in a cave, perhaps in
      Ethiopia—but prophecy points to a deeper truth: the Ark is a symbol of the
      Kingdom within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus reframed the expectation: not a golden chest to uncover, but a
      living temple in every heart. The true prophecy to be fulfilled may not be
      geological, but spiritual awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>✨ Closing Thought for Part 1:</strong> Perhaps the Ark will be
      found when mankind finally realizes that it was never truly lost.
