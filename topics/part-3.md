  <section id="intro" class="content">
    <h2>3.0 — Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Part 3 traces the person and teachings of Jesus — the point where expectations of a restored Zion intersect with a Kingdom he locates <em>within</em>. We examine canonical statements, hidden sayings, and the spiritual implications for Temple, Ark, and Israel’s identity.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Key reminder:</strong> Ark as symbol, prophetic inward focus, and hidden texts converge in Jesus’ words and actions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.1 -->
  <section id="kingdom-within" class="content">
    <h2>3.1 — The Kingdom Within (Canonical Texts)</h2>
    <p>Several canonical passages highlight the “Kingdom within”:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Luke 17:21</strong> — “The Kingdom of God is within you.” (<span title="Alternate translations: 'among you' or 'in your midst'">translation notes</span>)</li>
      <li><strong>John 14:20</strong> — “I am in my Father, you are in me, and I am in you.” — language of indwelling and union.</li>
      <li><strong>Matthew 6:9-10</strong> — Lord's Prayer: “Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” — linking inner transformation with cosmic order.</li>
      <li><strong>1 Corinthians 3:16</strong> — Paul: “Do you not know that you are God’s temple?” — God’s presence within community and body.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These texts relocate God’s throne from a physical chest to living people, inviting inward awakening rather than external quest.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“The Kingdom is not an object to possess but a reality to become.”</blockquote>

  <!-- 3.2 -->
  <section id="parables-practices" class="content">
    <h2>3.2 — Parables, Practices & Reorientation</h2>
    <p>Jesus’ parables and practices illustrate the inward focus of his teaching:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parables:</strong> Mustard seed, hidden treasure, yeast — small, internal processes reshaping the whole (cf. <span title="Matthew 13">Matthew 13</span>).</li>
      <li><strong>Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7):</strong> internal righteousness exceeding external observance.</li>
      <li><strong>Table fellowship:</strong> Meals with tax collectors and sinners re-map covenant boundaries — presence shown by proximity, not ritual purity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Jesus forms a new interior imagination rather than new institutions.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.3 -->
  <section id="temple-ark-reframe" class="content">
    <h2>3.3 — Temple & Ark Reframed</h2>
    <p>Jesus’ words and actions reinterpret Temple and Ark symbolism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>John 2:19–21</strong> — “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Referring to his body.</li>
      <li><strong>Luke 11 / Matthew 12</strong> — God’s presence among people outweighs any physical edifice.</li>
      <li><strong>Hebrews 8</strong> — New covenant: law written on hearts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the Ark was the mercy-seat, Jesus embodies it, distributing presence into the community through the Spirit.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.4 -->
  <section id="suppressed-teachings" class="content">
    <h2>3.4 — Suppressed & Non-Canonical Sayings</h2>
    <p>Extra-canonical texts emphasize the inward Kingdom:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Thomas</strong> — “The Kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you.” Saying 77: “Split a piece of wood; I am there.”</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Philip</strong> — Symbolic theology on union, sacrament, and indwelling Christ.</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Mary (Magdalene)</strong> — Inner vision, ascent, direct revelation; sidelined voices of early Christians.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">These writings emphasize gnosis (inner knowing), echoing canonical currents.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.5 -->
  <section id="mystical-echoes" class="content">
    <h2>3.5 — Mystical Echoes & Early Mystics</h2>
    <p>Early mystics cultivated the Kingdom as an inner journey:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Philo:</strong> Logos indwelling humanity, spiritual joining point for later mysticism.</li>
      <li><strong>Desert fathers & mothers:</strong> Prayer, silence, and inner purification.</li>
      <li><strong>Gnostic strands:</strong> Knowledge (gnosis) as the path to indwelling reality.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.6 -->
  <section id="implications" class="content">
    <h2>3.6 — Social & Political Implications</h2>
    <p>An inward Kingdom shifts allegiance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Challenges Temple authorities and imperial powers claiming spiritual legitimacy.</li>
      <li>Redefines identity — “true Israel” becomes those open to the Spirit.</li>
      <li>Fosters communities practicing alternative economics, hospitality, and restorative justice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Jesus’ movement both alarmed and attracted: threatening power while offering a radical ethic of care.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.7 -->
  <section id="practice" class="content">
    <h2>3.7 — Reflection & Practice</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="note">
        <strong>Short Practice: 10 Minutes</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Read <span title="Luke 17:20–21">Luke 17:20–21</span> slowly. Sit with the phrase: “The Kingdom is within you.”</li>
          <li>Breathe deliberately for five minutes, noticing where “Kingdom” is present in your body.</li>
          <li>Write one sentence: “Today I will live as if the Kingdom were near by…”</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>Use this practice in groups as a doorway — shifting attention from outward scanning to dwelling inward.</p>

  <!-- 3.8 -->
  <section id="closing" class="content">
    <h2>3.8 — Closing & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Jesus reframed the story: Ark symbolism, Temple function, and Israel’s identity redirect toward inward God-presence. Canonical texts, suppressed sayings, and mystical practices converge: the Kingdom forms internally and flows outward into justice and mercy.
