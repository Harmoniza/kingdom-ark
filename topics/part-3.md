  <section id="intro" class="content">
    <h2>3.0 — Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Part 3 follows the roots into the person and teaching of Jesus — the
      moment the expectation of a restored Zion collides with a Kingdom that he
      repeatedly locates <em>within</em>. This chapter traces canonical
      statements, the hidden sayings that preserved interior knowledge, and the
      spiritual consequences for how people imagine Temple, Ark, and peoplehood.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Reminder:</strong> Ark as symbol, prophets pointing inward, and
      hidden books preserving inner teachings converge in Jesus’ words and actions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.1 -->
  <section id="kingdom-within" class="content">
    <h2>3.1 — The Kingdom Within (Canonical Texts)</h2>
    <p>Several canonical passages are pivotal to the “Kingdom within” idea:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Luke 17:21</strong> — “The Kingdom of God is within you.” (<span title="Alternate translations: 'among you' or 'in your midst'">see translation notes</span>)</li>
      <li><strong>John 14:20</strong> — “I am in my Father, you are in me, and I am in you.” — language of indwelling and union.</li>
      <li><strong>Matthew 6:9-10</strong> — Lord's Prayer: “Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” — links inner transformation with cosmic order.</li>
      <li><strong>1 Corinthians 3:16</strong> — Paul: “Do you not know that you are God’s temple?” — God’s presence lives in the community and the body.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Taken together, these texts relocate God’s throne from a chest to a living people and invite inward awakening rather than hunting sacred objects.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“The Kingdom is not an object to possess but a reality to become.”</blockquote>

  <!-- 3.2 -->
  <section id="parables-practices" class="content">
    <h2>3.2 — Parables, Practices & Reorientation</h2>
    <p>Jesus uses parables and practices to illustrate the inward nature of his message:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parables:</strong> Mustard seed, hidden treasure, yeast — images of small, internal processes reshaping the whole (cf. <span title="Matthew 13">Matthew 13</span>).</li>
      <li><strong>Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7):</strong> internal righteousness that exceeds external observance.</li>
      <li><strong>Table fellowship:</strong> meals with tax collectors and sinners re-map covenant boundaries — presence shown by proximity, not purity alone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Jesus doesn’t mainly teach new institutions—he forms a new interior imagination.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.3 -->
  <section id="temple-ark-reframe" class="content">
    <h2>3.3 — Temple & Ark Reframed</h2>
    <p>Jesus’ actions and words dramatically reinterpret Temple and Ark symbolism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>John 2:19–21</strong> — “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Refers to his body.</li>
      <li><strong>Luke 11 / Matthew 12</strong> — Presence among the people outweighs the edifice.</li>
      <li><strong>Hebrews 8</strong> — New covenant: law “on the heart”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the Ark was the mercy-seat, Jesus becomes the living mercy-seat, and the Spirit distributes that presence into the community.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.4 -->
  <section id="suppressed-teachings" class="content">
    <h2>3.4 — Suppressed & Non-Canonical Sayings</h2>
    <p>Texts outside the canonical New Testament emphasize the inward Kingdom:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Thomas</strong> — “The Kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you.”; Saying 77: “Split a piece of wood; I am there.”</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Philip</strong> — Symbolic theology on union, sacrament, and indwelling Christ.</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel of Mary (Magdalene)</strong> — Inner vision, ascent, direct revelation; sidelined voices of early Christians.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">These writings emphasize gnosis (inner knowing), echoing currents in canonical texts.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.5 -->
  <section id="mystical-echoes" class="content">
    <h2>3.5 — Mystical Echoes & Early Mystics</h2>
    <p>Early Christian and Jewish mystics cultivated practices making the Kingdom an inner journey:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Philo</strong> — Logos indwelling humanity, a spiritual joining point for later mysticism.</li>
      <li><strong>Desert fathers and mothers</strong> — Prayer, silence, and inner purification.</li>
      <li><strong>Gnostic strands</strong> — Knowledge (gnosis) as the path to indwelling reality.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 3.6 -->
  <section id="implications" class="content">
    <h2>3.6 — Social & Political Implications</h2>
    <p>An inward Kingdom shifts allegiance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It unsettles Temple authorities and imperial systems claiming spiritual legitimacy.</li>
      <li>Redefines identity—“true Israel” becomes those opened to the Spirit.</li>
      <li>Creates communities practicing alternative economics, hospitality, and restorative justice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Jesus’ movement both alarmed and attracted: threatening power while offering a radical ethic of care.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="practice" class="content">
    <h2>3.7 — Reflection & Practice</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="note">
        <strong>Short practice: 10 minutes</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Read <span title="Luke 17:20–21">Luke 17:20–21</span> slowly. Sit with “the Kingdom is within you.”</li>
          <li>Breathe deliberately for five minutes, noticing where “kingdom” feels present in your body.</li>
          <li>Write one sentence: “Today I will live as if the Kingdom were near by…”</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>Use this practice in groups as a doorway — attention shifts from outward scanning to dwelling inward.</p>

  <!-- 3.8 -->
  <section id="closing" class="content">
    <h2>3.8 — Closing & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Jesus reframed the story: Ark symbolism, Temple function, and Israel’s identity are redirected toward inward God-presence. Canonical texts, suppressed sayings, and mystical practices converge: the Kingdom forms internally and flows outward into justice and mercy.
