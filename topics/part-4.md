      <h2>4.0 — Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        With the Kingdom located inward by Jesus, early Christian communities became living examples of this principle. Part 4 explores how house churches, hidden texts, and early mystics preserved the inward path, often in tension with emerging hierarchical structures.
      </p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Reminder:</strong> We trace the journey from small gatherings, hidden knowledge, and spiritual practice toward the larger institutional Church that codified, and sometimes excluded, certain currents.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.1 -->
    <section id="house-churches" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.1 — House Churches & Early Communities</h2>
      <p>
        Early Christians met primarily in private homes, forming networks of teaching, prayer, and communal life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acts 2:42–47 — Shared meals, breaking bread, teaching, prayer.</li>
        <li>Romans 16 — Greetings to local communities, showing decentralized life.</li>
        <li>1 Corinthians 11 — Practice of Eucharist in homes, often intimate and participatory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">These communities embodied the “Kingdom within” as lived experience — not simply doctrine.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.2 -->
    <section id="hidden-texts" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.2 — Hidden Texts & Gnostic Currents</h2>
      <p>
        Some teachings circulated secretly, emphasizing gnosis and the inner path:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gospel of Thomas — Collection of sayings preserved outside canonical oversight.</li>
        <li>Gospel of Philip — Emphasizes sacramental union and inner enlightenment.</li>
        <li>Gospel of Mary — Focus on soul ascent and guidance for inner knowledge.</li>
        <li>Other Gnostic writings — Valentinians, Sethians, and their mystical communities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">These currents were often sidelined, yet they were influential in shaping contemplative practice and alternative ethics.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.3 -->
    <section id="canon-formation" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.3 — Formation of the Canon</h2>
      <p>
        The canonization process was gradual, complex, and influenced by both spiritual and political factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Early letters and gospels circulated in communities — not formally “closed.”</li>
        <li>Marcion (2nd century) prompts the Church to define boundaries of authoritative texts.</li>
        <li>Some texts accepted later — e.g., Revelation; others excluded permanently — Thomas, Mary, Philip.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">The canon reflects what was publicly authoritative, not the totality of early Christian thought.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.4 -->
    <section id="councils" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.4 — Councils, Suppression, and Power</h2>
      <p>
        Councils like Nicaea (325 CE) and later gatherings enforced uniformity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They defined orthodoxy, hierarchy, and formal creeds.</li>
        <li>Suppressed alternative readings — mystical, gnostic, or inward-focused texts.</li>
        <li>Political alliances reinforced the Church’s power, sometimes marginalizing the “Kingdom within” emphasis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Understanding this helps us see why certain currents survived in hidden manuscripts, while others shaped official practice.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.5 -->
    <section id="mystical-practices" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.5 — Mystical Practices in Early Christianity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prayer, fasting, meditation, and communal meals as conduits for experiencing the inner Kingdom.</li>
        <li>Lectio Divina — contemplative scripture reading to awaken the Spirit within.</li>
        <li>Spiritual mentorship — elders guided disciples toward internal realization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">These practices preserved what the Ark and Jesus had symbolized: the presence of God within every believer.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.6 -->
    <section id="implications" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.6 — Implications for Understanding the Kingdom</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Kingdom is experienced communally, not only individually.</li>
        <li>Scriptures, when read contemplatively, guide inner life and ethics.</li>
        <li>Hidden teachings suggest that external observance alone is incomplete.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 4.7 -->
    <section id="closing" class="content" style="padding:1rem 2rem">
      <h2>4.7 — Closing Thoughts & Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Early Christians model the tension: living the Kingdom within, while institutions formalize and sometimes constrain it. Part 5 will explore **the evolution of mystics, apocryphal texts, and the enduring vision of the true Kingdom versus political Zion**, continuing the thread toward contemporary understanding.
