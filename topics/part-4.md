    <h2>4.0 — Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      With the Kingdom located inward by Jesus, early Christian communities became living examples of this principle. Part 4 explores how house churches, hidden texts, and early mystics preserved the inward path, often in tension with emerging hierarchical structures.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Reminder:</strong> From small gatherings, hidden knowledge, and spiritual practice emerged the institutional Church — codifying some currents and excluding others.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.1 -->
  <section id="house-churches" class="content">
    <h2>4.1 — House Churches & Early Communities</h2>
    <p>Early Christians met in private homes, forming networks of teaching, prayer, and communal life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acts 2:42–47 — Shared meals, breaking bread, teaching, prayer.</li>
      <li>Romans 16 — Greetings to local communities, showing decentralized life.</li>
      <li>1 Corinthians 11 — Eucharist in homes, intimate and participatory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      These communities embodied the “Kingdom within” as lived experience — not simply doctrine.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.2 -->
  <section id="hidden-texts" class="content">
    <h2>4.2 — Hidden Texts & Gnostic Currents</h2>
    <p>Some teachings circulated secretly, emphasizing gnosis and the inner path:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gospel of Thomas — Sayings preserved outside canonical oversight.</li>
      <li>Gospel of Philip — Emphasizes sacramental union and inner enlightenment.</li>
      <li>Gospel of Mary — Focus on soul ascent and guidance for inner knowledge.</li>
      <li>Other Gnostic writings — Valentinians, Sethians, and mystical communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Though often sidelined, these currents shaped contemplative practice and alternative ethics.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.3 -->
  <section id="canon-formation" class="content">
    <h2>4.3 — Formation of the Canon</h2>
    <p>The canonization process was gradual, complex, and influenced by spiritual and political factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Early letters and gospels circulated in communities — not formally “closed.”</li>
      <li>Marcion (2nd century) prompted the Church to define boundaries of authoritative texts.</li>
      <li>Some texts accepted later — e.g., Revelation; others excluded permanently — Thomas, Mary, Philip.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      The canon reflects what was publicly authoritative, not the totality of early Christian thought.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.4 -->
  <section id="councils" class="content">
    <h2>4.4 — Councils, Suppression, and Power</h2>
    <p>Councils like Nicaea (325 CE) enforced uniformity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined orthodoxy, hierarchy, and formal creeds.</li>
      <li>Suppressed alternative readings — mystical, gnostic, inward-focused texts.</li>
      <li>Political alliances reinforced Church power, marginalizing “Kingdom within” emphasis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Understanding this explains why certain currents survived in hidden manuscripts while others shaped official practice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.5 -->
  <section id="mystical-practices" class="content">
    <h2>4.5 — Mystical Practices in Early Christianity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prayer, fasting, meditation, and communal meals as conduits for experiencing the inner Kingdom.</li>
      <li>Lectio Divina — contemplative scripture reading awakening the Spirit within.</li>
      <li>Spiritual mentorship — elders guided disciples toward internal realization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      These practices preserved what the Ark and Jesus symbolized: God’s presence within every believer.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.6 -->
  <section id="implications" class="content">
    <h2>4.6 — Implications for Understanding the Kingdom</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kingdom is experienced communally as well as individually.</li>
      <li>Contemplative reading of scriptures guides inner life and ethics.</li>
      <li>Hidden teachings suggest that external observance alone is incomplete.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 4.7 -->
  <section id="closing" class="content">
    <h2>4.7 — Closing Thoughts & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Early Christians lived the Kingdom within, while institutions formalized and sometimes constrained it. Part 5 will explore <strong>the evolution of mystics, apocryphal texts, and the enduring vision of the true Kingdom versus political Zion</strong>, continuing the thread toward contemporary understanding.
